Some Quick stuff that needs to be done:
1. in newServer.py the function loadFile() is kinda screwed up
- it should read until the end of file regardless instead of just a fixed amount of bytes
2. newServer.py, instead of loading files for each server response
all files should be loaded up and kept in strings and then the strings should be sent for each request
3. The function threaded should be inside a while loop and only drop connection when no longer getting response
4. newServer.py should be non-blocking to increase performance (priority pretty low here also this gonna be tricky probably)


Larger Problems:
1. Login Signup is not finished
2. Literally the whole thing is missing
